# ðŸ›’ Product Catalog App

This project is a SwiftUI-based iOS application designed to showcase products in a grid layout, featuring an intuitive user interface that supports dark and light themes as well as dynamic text resizing for accessibility. The app fetches product data from a network API, caches images efficiently, and provides a detailed product view with smooth animations and custom design elements.

### Features

*  Product Grid View: Displays products in a responsive grid layout with pagination support.
* Product Details Overlay: Tap on a product to view detailed information in an overlay, with images, price, and stock level.
* Dynamic Theme Support: The app automatically adapts to both dark and light themes, ensuring a consistent experience across different settings.
* Accessibility Ready: Supports dynamic text resizing for improved accessibility, adapting UI elements to the userâ€™s preferred text size.
* Pull-to-Refresh: Allows users to refresh the product list with a pull-down gesture.
* Lazy Loading: Products load on-demand as the user scrolls, reducing memory usage and improving performance.
* Custom Caching: Images are cached locally to reduce network usage and improve loading times.
* Error Handling with Alerts: Provides user-friendly error messages when network issues occur, with retry options.
* Animated Loading Indicators: Includes a custom loading animation to enhance the user experience.

### Technical Highlights

* SwiftUI: The app is built entirely in SwiftUI, using Combine for reactive programming.
* Dependency Injection: Uses a DependencyContainer to manage dependencies, improving testability and modularity.
* Custom Image Loader: Efficient image loading with caching, resizing, and fallback handling.
* Network Layer: Abstracted API client with error handling and response validation, designed to handle various network scenarios (e.g., offline mode).
* Modular Components: Key components like ProductDetailView, LoadingView, and ScrollTrackingView are modular and reusable.
